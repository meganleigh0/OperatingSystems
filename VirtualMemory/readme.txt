This program tests the efficacy of various virtual memory page replacement schemes.
Implements four different page replacement schemes: first-in-first-out, least-recently used, least-frequently used, and optimal.  
Reads the sequence of page accesses from the file "pages.dat", emulates the four different paging schemes, and prints a short report detailing the relative performance statistics.
